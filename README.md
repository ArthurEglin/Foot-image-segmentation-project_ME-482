# Foot-image-segmentation-project_ME-482
Train an artificial neural network to perform segmentation of bones in CT scans of the foot in order to reconstruct a volumetric object representing the foot in 3D.


NOTES for the project:

- create a 3D model of the foot on a STL file using the output masks of the segmentation. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSyEbJ7Phis
- 3D print the model : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-lQPGJ3Psc
